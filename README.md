- Part 1: I'll show you the project and teach you some basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
- Part 2: Learn how to setup the environment and implement the Snake game.
- Part 3: Implement the agent that controls the game.
- Part 4: Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.

## Development

### Requirements

- Python: check with `python3 --version`
- pip: check with `python3 -m pip --version`
  - install with `sudo apt install python3-pip`

### Venv in VS Code

- Open folder
- Create Venv: `Python: Create Environment`
- Install dependencies:
  - Latest versions: `python3 -m pip install -r dependencies.txt`
  - Tested versions: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Add new packages

- Run `python3 -m pip install PACKAGE`
- Add manually to `dependencies.txt`
- Save with: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
