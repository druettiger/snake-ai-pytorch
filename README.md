# Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Tutorial series we teach an AI to play Snake! We build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. The tutorial consists of 4 parts:

- Part 1: I'll show you the project and teach you some basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.
- Part 2: Learn how to setup the environment and implement the Snake game.
- Part 3: Implement the agent that controls the game.
- Part 4: Implement the neural network to predict the moves and train it.

## Development

### Requirements

- Python & pip: `sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip`
  - check Python with `python3 --version` and
  - check pip with `python3 -m pip --version`
- Install dependencies: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Venv in VS Code

- Open folder
- Run `Python: Create Environment` (select `requirements.txt`)

### Add pip packages

- Run `python3 -m pip install PACKAGE`
- Manually add output of `pip freeze` to `requirements.txt`
